                In the ethereal realm of introspection,
                <br/>
                Where profound musings find connection,
                <br/>
                "What's up?" inquires with curious zest,
                <br/>
                A quest for truth, a soul's earnest request.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                Does "up" not transcend mere spatial notion,
                <br/>
                But touches the essence of human devotion?
                <br/>
                A striving for growth, for aspirations grand,
                <br/>
                A yearning to soar, to reach life's highest stand.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                Yet, let us not forget the humbling truth,
                <br/>
                That "up" may crumble, leaving but residue,
                <br/>
                For life's ebbs and flows, in their cyclic sway,
                <br/>
                Remind us that "up" is fleeting, a passing display.
